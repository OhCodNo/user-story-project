Gained the data from Terraria Wiki
https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_weapons

We implimented Quilbot, an AI to gain specific Arrays in neat, organized rows due to the website having a proper array and some elements being unavaible for website use.
We then used google sheets and seperated the data into rows so it would be compatable with code.org

Aiello helped us with the google sheet to make it more compatible with the txt file.

Me (Chris) used Aiello's user interaction example for some of the code

I (chris), had to use ChatGpt to correct errors and teach me a few code segments to make the program function with the txt, which resolved an issue with one of the values being unknown.

last, used AI to check the rubric and see if the code has each and everything needed.

I (Peter) used AI for tips on how to clean up the code to make it run smoother and remove unneccessary lines of code.
